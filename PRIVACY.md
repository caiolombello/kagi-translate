Privacy Policy for Kagi Translate Extension

Last Updated: 09/08/2025

Thank you for using the Kagi Translate extension. This Privacy Policy describes how your data is handled when you use our extension.

1. Data We Collect

Our extension handles two types of user data, only when you actively use it:

a) User Configuration Data: We use the browser's local storage (`chrome.storage`) to save your preferred settings. This includes your default target language, source language settings, and your chosen theme (light or dark). This data is stored only on your local machine and is never transmitted to us or any third party.

b) Content for Translation:
    - Selected Text: When you right-click on highlighted text and choose to translate, that specific text is collected.
    - Page URL: When you click the "Translate Page" button, the URL of your active tab is collected.

2. How We Use Your Data

The data collected is used exclusively to provide the core functionality of the extension:

- Your saved settings are used to personalize your translation experience.
- The selected text or page URL is sent directly to Kagi's public translation service (https://kagi.com/translate) to perform the translation.

3. Data Storage and Sharing

We do not have our own servers and we do not store any of your data. Your configuration settings are stored locally in your browser. The only data that leaves your browser is the text or URL you wish to translate, which is sent directly to the Kagi Translate service for processing. We do not collect or store any personally identifiable information.
